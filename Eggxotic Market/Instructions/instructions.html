    <h2>
        The Story
    </h2>
    <p>
    Your Grandather has sent you to the new local farmer's market to buy some exotic eggs he saw advertised on TV.
    </p>
    <p>
    He gives you a set amount of money to spend over the course of the 10 days that the market will be open. Each day, you have the chance to view 3 eggs, but only buy one. The price of the eggs can range anywhere from $100 to $900 each.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can only view one egg at a time, and if you don't like the price of the first egg, you can pass it to view the second. Once you pass an egg, you can never view it again. If you pass over both the first and second eggs, you must buy the third egg regardless of the price.
    </p>
    <p>â€¨Your Grandfather expects you to return from the market with exactly 10 eggs (one bought each day) and if possible, some money left over.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How To Play
    </h2>
    <p>
    Once you've started a game:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>View the price of the egg presented.</li>
    
        <li>If you like the price, you can tap the "BUY" button to purchase egg, and therefore ending the day and moving onto the next day.</li>
    
        <li>If you do not like the price, or you think you can find a cheaper egg, you can tap the "PASS" button to pass over it and view the next egg.</li>
    
        <li>Once you pass an egg, you cannot view it or have a chance to buy it again.</li>
    
        <li>If you pass the second egg (on the normal amount of 3 eggs) as well as the first, you must purchase the third egg, as you cannot go back. The day is then ended.</li>
    
        <li>You lose if you run out of money before buying 10 eggs.</li>
        
        <li>If you even want to stop playing and return to the main menu, tap the "QUIT" button.</li>
    
        <li>Be sure to be checking for the event on each day, as it may effect the price of the eggs, or the amount of eggs you can view.</li>
        
        <li>You can learn more about the current even in game, by tapping the "INFO" button.
    
        <li>The next section covers the different events in more detail.</li>
    
    </ul>
